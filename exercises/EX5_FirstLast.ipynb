    "A user wants a program that takes an a variable named temperature and print out the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"The temperature is x, \" where x is the value in temperature. It must be inserted into the string using an f-string.\n",

    "2. Add a second part to the message based on the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If the number is greater than 100, add \"and it is Very Hot!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If the number is greater than 90 and less than or equal to 100, add \"and it is Hot!\"\n",
