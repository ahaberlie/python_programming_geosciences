    "- Due: **10/12/2025 @ 11:59 p.m.**\n",
    "- Change the name of your notebook to HW2_FirstLast.ipynb, where First is your first name and Last is your last name.\n",
    "- For each of the following prompts, write or modify Python code that fulfills the requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Important information to remember\n",
    "\n",
    "- Periodically, you should click File -> Save Notebook\n",
    "- When you are done working for the day, click File -> Log Out\n",
    "- When you are finished, download the notebook and upload it to the submission link\n",
    "- I will reset the notebook and run each code block on its own. You will receive half credit if you rely on a variable from a previous or subsequent code block.\n",
