    "- Due: **11/2/2025 @ 11:59 p.m.**\n",
    "- Change the name of your notebook to HW4_FirstLast.ipynb, where First is your first name and Last is your last name.\n",
    "- For each of the following prompts, write or modify Python code that fulfills the requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Important information to remember\n",
    "\n",
    "- Periodically, you should click File -> Save Notebook\n",
    "- When you are done working for the day, click File -> Log Out\n",
    "- When you are finished, download the notebook and upload it to the submission link\n",
    "- I will reset the notebook and run each code block on its own. You will receive half credit if you rely on a variable from a previous or subsequent code block.\n",

    "You can see an example of this in [Chapter 5.2](https://ahaberlie.github.io/python_programming_geosciences/matplotlib-plot-examples/) if you upload the chapter and double click on the image that shows the climograph plot. The image must be visible (no \"broken links\"). You must use an example that was not included in the slideshows or online textbook chapter.\n",
