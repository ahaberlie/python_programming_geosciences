    "## Chapter 2.1.2 - Defining variables\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can use explicit (actual) numbers for mathematical and other operations, you will almost always be using variables instead. Variables, much like those used in your math courses, are *placeholders* for values. You might ask \"why would we need variables if we can just use the actual numbers?!\". The answer is *generalizability*. \n",
    "\n",
    "What if we need to create a program that allows a user to use an equation that could handle any possible integer? We do not have time to code *every* possible combination of numbers that the user might decide to use. In fact, it might be easier to control what values *cannot* be used. Instead, we use placeholders that can *vary* (i.e., variables) depending on the state of the program and/or decisions made by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "As was mentioned in chapter 2.0.4, variables retain the values they were assigned by the programmer as long as the program is running. Thus, as long as you define the correct value, it can be used as many times as you need. This idea is similar to how our brains develop the ability to understand [object permanence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_permanence). In other words, we can assume that an object that once existed still exists even if we cannot see the object. In Python terms, if you define a variable \"earlier\" in the program, you can assume that variable still exists \"later\" in the program. In other words, the [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)) of the program is remembered and persists as long as the program is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic pattern for defining variables is as follows (NOTE: the text and brackets just describes the item at that position, do not use brackets in this situation):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[variable name] = [operation]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the variable can contain any alphanumeric character:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, variable names are constrained by some strict limitations and styling guidelines (Table 2.1.t2). A typical Python variable has a simple, lowercase name that splits two or more words using an underscore (```_```). For example: ```split_words_using_underscore```. Some languages use [\"Camel Case\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) for their variable names, where words are separated using capital letters. For example ```CamelCase``` or ```TempF```. This is allowed, but is not preferred in Python scripts.\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "month = 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see on the left side of the ```=```, there is a variable name that adheres to the requirements in Table 2.1.t2. On the right side of the ```=```, there is an ```int```. As you may recall from section 2.0.4, the right side of the ```=``` is evaluated before the left side. Thus, the steps going on in the background are (very generally) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python determines if there are any syntax errors (errors in the code), if so, do not run the code but do provide an error message.\n",
    "2. Python prepares a memory location that will be represented for the programmer by the variable name ```month```. The specific details are determined by the data type.\n",
    "3. The value on the right is evaluated until it becomes a basic data type (e.g., ```int```). In other words, if there are mathematical or other operations, they will first be processed and reduced to their most basic representation. In this case, it was already as simple as possible. In more advanced situations, you can define variables as ```functions``` or ```objects```, but we will discuss this later in the course.\n",
    "4. The memory location represented by the variable name ```month``` is assigned the ```int``` value of 8.\n",
    "5. Following rule 1 (section 2.0.4), ```month``` (and its corresponding memory location) will be equal to 8 until the program changes its value or the program is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As was discussed in class, the \"memory location\" is within the computer's [Random-Access Memory (RAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory), and is not automatically saved to your hard drive. Once the program is closed, or the computer is turned off, the value associated with the variable is lost. This is a very common action (how often do you close programs? or turn your computer off?), so using Python code to \"save\" the steps to reproduce defining the variable is important for allowing your ideas, thoughts, and workflow to persist through more than one program / computer cycle. People often like to think of code as a recipe--as long as you know how Grandma Goody made her cookies, you can make them as many times as you want. The alternative is to just eat them once and never know how to make them again!\n",

    "Below are working Python code examples of setting 4 variables with 4 operations, and then displaying (\"printing\") the value for each variable."
