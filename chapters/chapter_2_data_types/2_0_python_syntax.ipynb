    "# Chapter 2 - Python Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is the most popular [general-purpose programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language). According to a StackOverflow 2024 [survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#most-popular-technologies-language), only Javascript and HTML/CSS are more popular than Python, and Python is the most popular language for those learning to code. \n",

    "## 2.0.1 - Programming language structure\n",
    "\n",
    "In typical [four-year Computer Science programs](https://catalog.niu.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=62&poid=16943), there are multiple courses dedicated to the critical analysis of [programming language design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_design_and_implementation). Each language has advantages and disadvantages that are obvious and not so obvious. Sometimes the choice of language is made for you by your job. However, if you can pick the language, what you choose in 2025 will very likely not be what you choose in 2045. Thus, it is good to know the general structure of programming languages so you can jump between languages without trouble. Because of this, Computer Science programs typically teach courses in [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), or other [high-level programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language) due to their popularity in many fields as well as their general [object oriented programing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) paradigm. Depending on the interests of the faculty, you might examine [COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL), [perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl), [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)), [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran), and even [assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.0.2 - Python vs. C++ comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing and choosing programming languages, you need to consider many things, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Hardware requirements - Is the program running on an embedded device with limited RAM? Does it need to run on old laptops?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> &#10060; If response time is crucial and memory is limited, C++ or similar languages may be a better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "> &#9989; Python can take advantage of the speed of C++ when it serves as a [wrapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrapper_library) for an existing C++ library.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Project requirements - Are there budget limitations? How big is the program/team? What risks are involved?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> &#10060; Python uses [duck typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing), which can make development, testing, and maintenance more difficult compared to C++ or similar languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "> &#9989; Python has been moving towards better type handling using approaches like [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Ease of use - what is the experience level of your team? How quickly do you need to have a proof of concept?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> &#9989; Python generally requires fewer lines of code to do the same thing as more complex languages. Consider the \"Hello World!\" example\n",
    "\n",
    "> > Python\n",
    "> > > ```print(\"Hello World!\")```\n",
    "\n",
    "> > C++\n",
    "> > > ```\n",

    "The computer will process the Python code you write starting from the top of the notebook and downward.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, you will print out \"First\" and \"Second\" using ```print```. Python will process the first line, which tells the computer to print out \"First\". Next, it will process the second line, which tells the computer to print out \"Second\". New text will appear below the code block which signifies the code has been successfully processed (also referred to as *executed*). Try making small changes to the code below to see what happens. "
