    "Often a ```class``` will be defined in a ```.py``` file that is separate from the notebook. Luckily, Python (and other languages) provide an easy way to provide the ```class``` definition information to your notebook scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process we will use is called **importing**. This is an incredibly important concept, because most of your interaction with Python will happen by using pre-existing software packages that have ```classes```, ```properties```, and ```methods``` that organize data and perform tasks that make your life easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the [```matplotlib```](https://matplotlib.org/stable/) package was designed specifically to provide an easy-to-use interface for making visual representations of data through a process called \"plotting\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this basic case, however, we are simply importing a file named ```my_file.py``` that looks like this:\n",

    "```\n",

    "    def __init__(self, high, low, dew, pres):\n",

    "        self.low_temperature = low\n",
    "        self.dewpoint = dew\n",
    "        self.pressure = pres\n",
    "\n",
    "    def F_to_K(self):\n",
    "        K = (self.high_temperature + 459.67) * (5 / 9)\n",
    "        return K\n",
    "\n",
    "    def F_to_C(self):\n",
    "        C = (self.high_temperature - 32) * (5 / 9)\n",
    "        return C\n",
    "```\n",
    "It has a [```constructor method```](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_(object-oriented_programming)) that requires the user to define high and low temperatures, a dewpoint, and a pressure. The class also has ```methods``` that convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Kelvin, and from Fahrenheit to Celsius.\n",

    "In Colab, upload this notebook and open the project manager menu (looks like three dots and three lines on the left side of the page). Then click on the folder icon. Once the runtime is connected, right click in the area under \"sample_data\" and select \"New File\" and name it ```my_file.py```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the ```Observation``` class code above (do not copy the ``````). Double click on ```my_file.py``` in Colab and it will open a text editor on the right side of the page. Paste the ```Observation``` code into that editor.\n",
