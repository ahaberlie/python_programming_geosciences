    "# Chapter 7.1 - Spatial Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 2, we learned about primitive and composite data types in Python. One of the comparisons we made to the \"real world\" was chess. Each chess piece has a set of rules that allow them to move in certain ways (with advantages and disadvantages). The pawn, for example, has a very limited set of moves, whereas the queen has almost all of the moves that other chess pieces have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial data types are similar. At the highest level, there are two major spatial data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Raster Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) - Representations of spatial data using an n-dimensional array representing equally-spaced geographic/geometric regions (i.e., cells, grid cells, pixels, etc.). Typically used for continuous spatial data.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. [Vector Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model_(GIS)#Vector_data_model) - Representations of spatial data using geometric / geographic coordinates (i.e., points, lines, polygons, etc.). Typically used to describe a specific geographic coordinate or set of coordinates.\n",

    "In the Geosciences, these are examples of each data type:\n",

    "2. [Earthquake Frequency Map](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/frequency-damaging-earthquake-shaking-around-us)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will discuss [geographic information systems (GIS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) and their applications in the Geosciences. Applicable GIS processes can include simple mapping and cartography, vector transforms, and even complex raster analyses.\n",

    "### Vector Data in Geopandas\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 6, we learned about the Python package named ```pandas```. It was very useful for reading in and analyzing tabular data. ```geopandas``` can be understood as an extension of ```pandas```--namely, it allows geometric/geographic data to be attached to tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples above (earthquake information, rainfall observations, etc.), three types of information are stored:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Attributes** -- descriptive variables that can be used either in spatial or non-spatial analyses. Often these include date and time information, as well as variables for a particular problem. For example, precipitation totals can be added up to find a sum over a date period using non-spatial variables;\n",
    "2. **Location** - variables that encode a geographic location. The most basic coordinate system used is latitude/longitude degrees, but some projected coordinate systems use meters or even feet.\n",
    "3. **Metadata** - descriptions of the data that add more context. For example, the coordinate system, units, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ```geopandas``` the **attributes** of the event/observation are handled by the basic ```pandas``` methods, whereas the location and metadata information are handled by ```geopandas``` methods. As a result, you can transfer your pandas knowledge directly to geopandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, I use cartopy to quickly download a [shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) that describes the location and boundaries of countries using vector information.\n",
    "\n",
    "```import cartopy.io.shapereader as shpreader``` imports the specific \"shapefile reader\" (shpreader) tool. This tool has a method called ```natural_earth``` that automatically downloads common shapefiles (like state, country, etc., boundaries).\n",

This rotates the sphere (i.e., Earth's representation) so that the two points are on the \"equator\" of the sphere (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_distance). For relatively small distances, especially within projected coordinates, it is reasonable to treat the coordinates as [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), as long as there is not a need for extremely accurate measurements.

    "\n",
    "```Shapely``` (and by extension, ```geopandas```) provides multiple types of methods that can manipulate, measure, and analyze geometric objects. The general types of processes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Affine transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation): Methods that can translate (move), rotate (modify the orientation), and/or scale (change size) geometric objects. The full list of methods can be found in the [Shapely Documentation - Affine](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/2.1.1/manual.html#affine-transformations).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Spatial Relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_relation): Methods that test the existence of certain relationships for a geometry or between geometry. For example, is one object inside the other object? Do the two objects intersect in space? The full list of methods can be found in the [Shapely Documentation - Spatial Relationships](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/2.1.1/manual.html#predicates-and-relationships).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [Measurements](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/2.1.1/measurement.html): geometry-aware measurements of object length, area, perimeter, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. [Constructive](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/2.1.1/constructive.html): geometry-aware manipulations that create a new polygon from the original polygon. Examples include buffer, bounding box, geometry simplifications, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. [Overlay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_overlay): Widely-used methods (sometimes called ```set operations```) that overlay multiple geometric objects to create a new object with geometric features derived from the original objects. Examples include union, intersect, etc. The full list of methods can be found in the [Shapely Documentation - Set Operations](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/2.1.1/set_operations.html)\n",
