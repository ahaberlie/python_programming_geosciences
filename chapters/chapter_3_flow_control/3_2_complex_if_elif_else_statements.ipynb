    "## Chapter 3.2.1 - ```if``` statement review\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic ```if``` statements syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if (test):\n",
    "    code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, ```code``` will only run if ```test``` is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like the evaluation order for setting variables, ```test``` is the first thing that is processed in the ```if``` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only requirement for ```test``` is that it is a single ```bool``` after it is evaluated. This is simple if only one test is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "temperature = 50\n",
    "\n",
    "if (temperature > 95):\n",
    "    code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, ```temperature > 95``` is recognized by Python as a test that needs to be changed into a ```bool```. Since 50 is not greater tha 95, the ```bool``` in this case is ```False```.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 3.2.2 - Complex conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you needed multiple tests? For example, say that you need to make sure the temperature was between 0 C and 100 C:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "temperature = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "condition1 = temperature >= 0\n",
    "condition2 = temperature <= 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we use both condition1 and condition2? By using the following keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```and``` or ```&```: this combines two tests by requiring both tests to be ```True``` to result in ```True```\n",
    "- ```or``` or ```|```: this combines two tests by requiring at least one test to be ```True``` to result in ```True```\n",
