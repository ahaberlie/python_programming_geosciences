    "# Chapter 1.1 - Integrated Development Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will be using [Jupyter notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter) as our [integrated development environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). Jupyter notebooks allow us to combine [Python code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), [Markdown code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), [program input and output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output), and other useful information into one, self-contained [graphical user interface (GUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface).\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern IDEs allow Python software developers like you to execute and annotate code, view graphical program output, [organize and manage software packages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager), [use software project management tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_software), and receive feedback from tools like [syntax highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting) that can analyze code to identify errors. Some IDEs even include [code completion tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_completion) using [generative artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence).\n",

    "## 1.1.1 - Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks use common web browser functionality to display graphical information and connect to a [Jupyter notebook server](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html) that can be run locally (Fig. 1.1.f1) or remotely (e.g., <a href=\"https://triton.niu.edu\">EAE's triton</a>, <a href=\"https://colab.google.com\">google colab</a>, etc.). Remote servers require only a web browser to access, which greatly reduces the computing requirements on your end and eliminates the need for you to go through the complicated setup steps. Because of this, Jupyter notebooks are one of the most popular ways to develop and share code, particularly for academic research (Fig. 1.1.f2) or jobs that rely heavily on prototyping and visualization. During this course, we will be using the notebook interface to complete examples, exercises, assignments, and your final project. These notebooks should be included in a [career portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career_portfolio) that demonstrates your Python skills to future employers. In other words, the learning curve needed to master the basic usage of notebooks will be worthwhile and make you more desirable to employers. Project managers and hiring committees like to see tangible evidence of coding experience.\n",

    "## 1.1.2 - Markdown Code in Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we learn about Python code, we will explore some examples of text formatting in Jupyter Notebooks using Markdown code. Markdown code is a [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language) that takes [plain text language (like English)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) and formats it in specific ways using markup [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)). The syntax of the language defines program behavior (such as formatting text) using specific keywords and/or characters.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2.1 - Headings\n",
    "\n",
    "You can organize your markdown text by using **headings**. Headings usually identify the start of a section, subsection, etc. There are several examples provided in this notebook already. If you double click on the Markdown cells, the code for those headings would look like this:\n",

    "```\n",
    "# Top heading\n",
    "## Secondary heading\n",
    "### Tertiary heading\n",
    "```\n",

    "The character that tells Jupyter to display a top heading or secondary heading is the ```#``` symbol, and an increasing number of these symbols correspond to lower and lower headings.\n",
