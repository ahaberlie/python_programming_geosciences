        "This lab will help you understand Geopandas and its capabilities. We will walk through some examples of how geopandas can help solve Geoscience problems. Periodically, I will 1) ask you to either repeat the demonstrated code in a slightly different way; or 2) ask you to combine two or more techniques to solve a problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please do not use generative AI to answer these problems. In one example, I provide generative AI code that \"solves\" a problem and ask you to tell me where it went wrong. It is crucial that you understand the code well enough to effectively use generative AI tools that are likely to be widely available and recommended for use at many organizations. Although they are improving at an incredible rate, they still produce bugs, especially with domain-specific and complex problems.\n",
